# SchiffeVersenken

My first little successfull software project: Battleship.
This piece of software was developed in February 2021 from
Christian Bauer. 
Used technologies/concepts:
- C# and Visual Studio 2019
- Windows Forms for the GUI
- SoC
- MVC
- Classes and objects
- Unit Testing
- Methods 

Further fixes: When the repo is downloaded, the .gitignore 
ignores every Build made (Debug folder). So the software
cannot be executed.
